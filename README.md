As I continue to build out [waylonwalker.com](https://waylonwalker.com/) I sometimes run into some errors that are not caught becuase I do not have good testing implemented.  I want to explore some integration testing options using GitHub actions.

Running integration tests will not prevent bugs from happening completely, but it will allow me to quickly spot them and roll back
